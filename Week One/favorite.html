            <h2 class="section-header">My Favorite Movie</h2>
            <p>My favorite movie is <span id="favorite-movie-title">Waiting for Guffman</span>. It is a mockumentary documenting 
                of the process of a small southern town's original theatre production, "Red, White, & Blaine," 
                which is being mounted to celebrate the town's sesquicentennial (that's 150 years!) anniversary. 
                It has a rag-tag cast of characters who are quirky and relatable. <strong>Especially</strong> if you're a theatre nerd. 
                You can watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmkjNb3jiJc" target="_blank">movie trailer on YouTube</a>.</p>

            <h2 class="section-header">My Favorite Artist</h2>
            <p>My favorite artist is <span id="favorite-music-name">Imogen Heap</span>. She is, <em>in my opinion</em>, a pioneer in the 
                alt-electro-pop movement. Her music is hip and inventive. 
                For more info, check out <a href="http://www.imogenheap.com/" target="_blank">Imogen's website</a>.
                If you like that, check out some of her earlier work with Guy Sigsworth and the group <i>Frou Frou</i>.</p>

            <h2 class="section-header">My Favorite Foods</h2>
            <p>I love food. You might go so far as to say that preparing food for others is one of my love languages. Here are three dishes, to which, even if I'm not hungry,
                I'll not say, "No thanks."</p>
            <ul>
                <li id="most-favorite-food">Spaghetti with meatballs</li>
                <li>Curry with naan</li>
                <li>Crispy egg rolls</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="section-header">My Favorite Images</h2>
            <p>My photographer friends tell me that good photographs are just capturing light at it's best. My favorite images are those that focus on the light
                and not the object.</p>
